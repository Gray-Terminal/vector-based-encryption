# 3D Vector-Based Encryption Research

## Overview
This repository documents my undergraduate research into novel 3D vector-based encryption approaches as alternatives to traditional 2D matrix operations in block ciphers.

## Research Goals
- Explore 3D vector operations for cryptographic diffusion
- Develop prototype implementations of vector-based ciphers  
- Compare performance and security properties against AES
- Contribute to cryptographic research methodology

## Current Progress
- âœ… Implemented classic ciphers (Caesar, VigenÃ¨re)
- ðŸ”„ Studying AES fundamentals and cryptanalysis
- ðŸ“š Learning mathematical foundations (linear algebra, modular arithmetic)
